    <h1>Supriyaa Chordia</h1>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student at UC San Diego, USA majoring in Cognitive Psychology with minors in Data Science & Design. My hometown is in Mumbai, India.Beginning my education as a mechanical engineer, soon realized my passions lied in designing meaningful and interactive products by utilizing behavioral insights. As an enthusiastic product designer with education in Psychology, Data Science, and Engineering Design, I bring a cross-functional skillset that allows me to amalgamate systematic problem-solving with iterative design thinking, offering an interdisciplinary perspective on human-centered initiatives. I find myself intrigued by both the physical and virtual facets of data-driven product design. Looking for opportunities to learn new skills and collaborate with  others to create a meaningful social impact!</p>
